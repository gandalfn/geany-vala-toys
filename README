Geany Vala Toys is a collection of plugins to made vala development with geany
more easier.

For now this project, only contains two plugins:
  - The first one GVT Dock is a plugin to enable docking (with gdl 2.x) in geany
  - The second one GVT Project is a autotools plugin (mostly inspired from
    Vala Toys for gEdit http://code.google.com/p/vtg/)

This plugins are made for my personal usage and requirements which can defer
from usual development usage.
